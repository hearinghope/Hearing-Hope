// Question: What is mixed hearing loss, and how is it managed?
// Answer:- Mixed hearing loss combines aspects of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. Usually, the inner ear or auditory nerve and the outer or middle ear are injured. Management includes a combination of treatments appropriate for both types of hearing loss, such as surgery and hearing aids.

// Question: Are there preventative measures for hearing loss?
// Answer: Yes, many forms of hearing loss can be prevented. Preventative measures include protecting ears from loud noises with earplugs or earmuffs, avoiding prolonged exposure to noisy environments, maintaining good ear hygiene, having regular hearing check-ups, and leading a healthy lifestyle to support overall ear health.

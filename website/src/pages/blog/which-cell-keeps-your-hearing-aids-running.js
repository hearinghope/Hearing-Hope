          <h2>Inside the Mercury Cell: A Look at the Chemistry</h2>
        </div>
        <div className={styles.BlogDescription}>
          <p>Mercury cells, also known as zinc-mercury oxide cells, generate electricity through a chemical reaction. Here&apos;s a breakdown of the critical components:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Anode: </strong>Made from a zinc-mercury amalgam (a mixture of zinc metal and mercury). Zinc atoms lose electrons during operation and become positively charged ions (oxidation).</li>
            <li><strong>Cathode: </strong>Composed of mercuric oxide (HgO) mixed with graphite or carbon powder. The mercuric oxide accepts electrons (reduction), transforming into elemental mercury (Hg).</li>
            <li><strong>Electrolyte: </strong>A paste containing potassium hydroxide (KOH) and zinc hydroxide (ZnOH). This medium allows the flow of ions between the anode and cathode, facilitating the electrical current.</li>
            
          </ul>
          <p>The following equation can represent the chemical reaction within the cell: <br></br>
          Zn(Hg) + 2HgO + 2KOH → 2Zn(OH)2 + 2Hg + 2e-
As the reaction progresses, the zinc anode gradually dissolves, while the mercuric oxide at the cathode is converted to mercury metal. This flow of electrons creates the electrical current that powers your hearing aid.
